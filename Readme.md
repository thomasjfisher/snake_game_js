Welcome to my <a href="https://tjf-snakegame.netlify.app/">Snake Game!</a>


I have recently started learning JavaScript, and thought it would be a great opportunity to create a game using JavaScript to help with my learning.

I followed along to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY&t=813s">tutorial</a> in order to create the game. I have managed to learn many things in doing so.

I added my own stlying to the css file and have taken my game from a boring old snake game, to a easy on the eyes, enjoyable game!

10/10 would recommend.
